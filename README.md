## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I had some issues centering text in buttons due to the inherent line-heights with fonts. I was able to center the texts by placing them in spans within the buttons and positioning them absolutely within the buttons. I'm not confident that this is the ideal solution, however it is functional and stays centered in every screen size.

### Continued development

This type of rating submission is a very unique one, and I intend to incorporate this system in future production projects.
